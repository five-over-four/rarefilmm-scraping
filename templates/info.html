    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>This project began by scraping the <a href="https://rarefilmm.com">Rarefilmm.com</a> website for movie information
        using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">Beautiful Soup</a> library for python. Initially, we were 
        going for some idea about the genre distributions of the films on the site in comparison to more objective sources, such as 
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">imdb</a>, but eventually landed on the idea of a movie recommendation system.
        <br><br>
        We would take user input- a movie the user enjoys, and recommend movies from our more nich√© database based on it.
        This web application was a last-minute idea, as it seemed interesting to practice some HTML, CSS, and Python's <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/">Flask library</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        As it turned out, to make a reasonable movie recommendation system, we needed much more than just the titles, release years, and genres that
        our scraped data contained. We found the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">TMDB API</a> and got to work, using the API to collect
        the missing data for the movies, mostly by using the script 'collect_metadata.py' found in the project's files, filling in information such as
        the rating, poster-urls, overviews of the films.
        <br><br>
        The data took a lot of work to collect properly due to lots of inconsistencies in TMDB's output, getting the Rarefilmm data to conform with the TMDB
        entries and so forth. Most of the collection and cleaning was done in Jupyter Notebooks later into the project.
    </p>
    <h2>The Recommendation System</h2>
    <p>
        TODO.

    </p>
    <h2>This Web Application</h2>
    <p>
        The site is made up of entirely custom CSS and HTML, running on Flask. TODO.
