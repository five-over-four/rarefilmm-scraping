# Contains all the scraped data.

USE `rf_data.csv`. It is the most current of the data files and contains columns "title", "year", "genre", "country", "url", and "poster-path". This file is a combination of `cleaned_titles_data.csv` and `cleaned_urls.csv`, along with extra poster urls.

The poster-path is None for 4 entries, as those pages don't actually have a background image.
